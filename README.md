# Linear Regression Implementation with Scikit-Learn and Custom Model
This repository contains two Python implementations of linear regression.

Scikit-Learn Multiple Linear Regression: A straightforward implementation using sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression to perform multiple linear regression on a random created dataset.
Custom Linear Regression Class: A manually implemented linear regression model for which i have used diabetes dataset.

Features  
✅ Scikit-Learn model for quick and efficient regression modeling.  
✅ Custom implementation for understanding the inner workings of linear regression.  
✅ Comparison of both approaches on the same dataset.  
✅ Also i have plot the scatter plot.  

Feel free to clone, modify, and experiment!
